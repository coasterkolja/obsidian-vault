**"Vince is responsible for his own happiness." (p. 133, l. 14f.)**  
Clark is speaking here about his son Vince, who is breaking away from his father's expectations.  
Clark justifies why he doesn’t support or control Vince more – it’s a mix of resignation and self-justification. It’s an expression of powerlessness, but also an attempt to shift the blame: if Vince distances himself from the privileged world of his family, that’s his problem, not Clark’s.

**"Actually, Cindy thinks I'm not angry enough. And that makes her angry, like somehow I'm giving up on him because I don't love him enough. But the thing is, I almost admire him." (p. 146, l. 14–16)**  
Clark is again talking about Vince. Cindy (Clark’s wife) is angry at Vince because he rejects the life they built for him. Clark, on the other hand, has a different perspective: he secretly admires that Vince is going his own way. This shows Clark’s growing distance from the ideals of his world and the beginning of self-reflection.

**"There are times when careers must take priority." (p. 133, l. 27)**  
Typical of Clark as a Wall Street man: career over family. This sentence reflects his value system – or at least what he tells himself to justify his life. It serves as an explanation for his emotional absence at home, but at the same time carries a certain sadness or guilt.

**"Every time Clark was in the car, [...] he was shouting at someone, arguing about something. He seemed angry, frustrated, confused, resigned." (p. 143, l. 1–4)**  
This is Jende’s observation, the chauffeur, about Clark’s daily life. It is an external perspective on Clark’s emotional state: constantly on edge, stressed, perhaps even on the verge of collapse. This quote clearly shows how exhausting Clark’s working world is – behind the success is an exhausted, unhappy man.

**"You watch sunsets, sir?" "Nothing relaxes me more." (p. 145, l. 23f.)**  
A rare moment of peace. Jende and Clark share a quiet conversation, and Clark shows an unusually human side. In this scene, it becomes clear that Clark does have an emotional, thoughtful side – but in his everyday life, there’s barely any space for it. The sunset here symbolizes a longing for inner peace.

**"But everything I have, I worked hard for, and I'm proud of, and I'll fight to the end to preserve it." (p. 147, l. 4f.)**  
Clark here defends his life so far – his work, his status, his wealth. It is an expression of pride, but also of fear: everything he has built is under threat, whether through the economic crisis or family tensions. The sentence shows how much his self-worth is tied to his professional success.

**"When I went to Stanford I was going to study physics, become a professor like my dad. Then I saw what was possible on a professor's salary and what was possible on an investment banker's salary and I chose this path." (p. 147, l. 10–13)**  
Here Clark reflects on his career path: he actually wanted to become a physics professor like his father – but the money on Wall Street was too tempting. This is a classic example of the conflict between idealism and pragmatism, a central theme of the novel. Clark begins to question his life choices.

**"I can't say I didn't fantasize about the sports car and private jets. But it's different now. Now it means the world to me how well I'm taking care of my family. No matter how bad it gets at work I know that at the end of the day I can send my parents on vacations to see the world, pay for every medical bill that comes up, make sure my sister doesn't suffer because her husband's dead, make sure my wife and sons have far more than what they need." (p. 147, l. 15–21)**  
Clark describes his transformation: from superficial pursuit of wealth to the motivation of providing security for his family. It is an attempt to morally justify his stressful job – and at the same time a bitter realization that even this noble motivation does not bring him happiness.

**"You write poems, sir?" "Yeah, but I'm no Shakespeare or Frost. [...] Feels real good to just write out lines about whatever you're feeling." (p. 148, l. 29f. / p. 149, l. 12f.)**  
Another rare, intimate moment between Clark and Jende. Clark reveals that he writes poetry – a surprising and very personal side of him. Writing poems is a kind of outlet for him, an expression of his suppressed emotions. This scene makes Clark appear human and vulnerable.
