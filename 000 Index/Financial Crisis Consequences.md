    - Could result in social unrest or demands for redistributive policies (e.g., universal basic income).

    - Continued skepticism may lead to decentralization via crypto-assets, DeFi (decentralized finance), and fintech.
    - Potential weakening of traditional banking dominance.
- **Policy Overcorrection Risks**
    - Excessive regulation could stifle innovation or limit credit availability.
    - Political backlash could lead to deregulation cycles that ignore systemic risk.

    - Potential for future crises in emerging markets or heavily indebted developed nations.
