## 2a)
- Reading habits do influence opinions, but echo chambers/filter bubbles are less powerful than often claimed
- Users don’t only visit polarised sites – they also consume diverse sources
- Exposure to opposing views can even backfire, making people more convinced of their own beliefs
- Psychological biases and anonymity in debates fuel polarisation more than algorithms alone
## 2b)
- The article questions the myth: their influence is overstated.
- Supported by studies (Flaxman, Pew, Dubois, Bail) showing overall varied media diets.
- Main problem lies in human psychology and online interaction, not just algorithms.
- Conclusion: polarisation has multiple causes; solution is media literacy and critical thinking.
