When people think of the DDR, they often imagine a society of restricted communication, where information was carefully filtered and citizens were told what they could or could not say. Ironically, decades later, we find ourselves facing a new kind of control: not from a government, but from social media algorithms. Platforms shape what young people see, think, and feel, not through censorship, but through manipulation.

In this sense, banning social media for minors isn’t about limiting freedom. It is about protecting it. In a world where algorithms dictate what we think and keep us glued to the screen for as long as possible, just to squeeze the last pennies of advertising revenue out of us, regulation is utterly necessary. Of course, one could argue, that in a free society, control over any medium is a step towards opression. However, I believe, in a world where the major technology companies and social media platforms, with a monopoly position. At the point, where the algorithms influence our behavior, our elections, and the public opinion, there really is not that big of a difference to an oppressive dictatorship.
Especially parents should be concerned about the youth. There are so many dangers on social media. Everyone is connected, and behind a screen, everyone is technicall anonymous. In the best case, your kid is only talking to their friends, through an encrypted messenger. But think about other scenarios. What if they are chatting with a child predator without even knowing. And how would you even know. It is basically impossible.
